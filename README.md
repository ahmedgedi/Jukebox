What is Jukebox?
==================
An online web application currently hosted on Heroku. I started this for the Winterim product pitch competition. Jukebox is an app idea, one aggregated music search engine to browse multiple online music streaming services in one app. 

Additional features
----------------------

+ Collabrative playlist feature
	- Create a playlist with your friends and vote on music in the queue. No more passing the AUX cord around on those long road trips, let democracy set the tune

+ Data/Quality Optimization
	- Is streaming music cutting into your data plan? Jukebox lets you filter your music search based on how much data each music file will need. 
	- In that same filtering feature, if data usage isn't as much of a problem for you you can filter for very high quality files as well. 

+ More coming soon!
